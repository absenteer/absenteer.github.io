#Week 1.2 HTML Poem

E.E. Cummings has a very distinct writing style that is integral to his poetry. Did my best to format in a way that suited his style but couldn't find a simple solution to properly offset some of the text. I ended up using HTML better suited for lists, but it worked very well for the look I was trying to achieve.

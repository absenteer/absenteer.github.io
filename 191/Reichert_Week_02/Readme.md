#Sketch Week 2

The main concept is very simple but having to be ultra specific with point placemnet makes me realize how much I take Photoshop for granted. 

Eventually it all started feeling familiar. Being able to layer shapes and lines, adding color... it's all very basic and feels archaic but it's deeply deeply humbling. 

Had some issues getting the sketch to Github but we ironed out that issue in class.
